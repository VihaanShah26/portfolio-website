    I participated in several workshops through the year which covered important concepts in manufacturing and robotics. I learned how to use various types of 3D printers as well as their mechanisms and I mastered programming microcontrollers using the Arduino IDE.

    We participated in the ASME EFx Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge wherein I was the Head of the Electronics team. We leveraged Solidworks CAD, Arduino, and Prusa MK3S+ and Ender 3 V2 printers to build a hovercraft, remotely controlled by a joystick, capable of navigating a maze and delivering a payload. I directed the electronics team through each aspect of the hovercraftâ€™s wiring, programming and remote communication.

    My team was awarded Runner's Up among the Big Ten Schools.
